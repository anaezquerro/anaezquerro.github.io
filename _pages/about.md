Hi:wave: I am a first-year PhD student at the [Institute of Machine Learning and Neural Computation](https://www.iml.tugraz.at), [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/), supervised by [Ozan Özdenizci](https://oozdenizci.github.io/). I hold a BSc in [Data Science and Engineering](https://estudos.udc.es/en/study/detail/614g02v01) and a MSc in [Artificial Intelligence](https://mia.udc.es/) from the [University of A Coruña](https://www.udc.es). 

My early research at the [MODES group](https://dm.udc.es/modes/) focused on time series analysis and machine learning methods applied to statistics (2021-2022). Afterward, I shifted toward graph and tree parsing (2023-2025) within the [LyS Group](https://www.grupolys.org/lys_en.html), where I had the privilege to closely collaborate with [Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez](https://www.grupolys.org/~cgomezr/) and [David Vilares](https://www.grupolys.org/~david.vilares/). Currently, my research interests are evolving to efficient and robust deep learning, as part of my PhD at [TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/) within the [Bilateral AI](https://www.bilateral-ai.net/home) project.
